# BBoxer: Your friendly neighbourhood bounding box estimator

### Files
- rectangle_fitting1 => orignal code
- rectangle_fitting2 => my first version Lshape-fitting based on rectangle_fitting1
- rectangle_fitting3 => an implementation true to the paper's algorithm

The code in rectangle_fitting_1.py is taken from here [here](https://github.com/Silas-Asamoah/Lshape-fitting). Since there are no licenses mentioned, MIT license is presumed and used until further notice

rectangle_fitting_2.py is inspired from rectangle_fitting1 and rectangle_fitting3.py is an implementation that is most true to the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7995698).

Currently rectangle_fitting3.py is very inefficient and doesn't even compute for a single point cloud. 

### TODO:
- Implement rectangle_fitting3.py in rust or c++
